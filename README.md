# Computer Vision coursework at McGill University

## Image Filtering
- Thresholding
- Denoising, Sharpening
- Edge Detection (Sobel, Laplacian of Gaussian, Canny)

## Feature Extraction
- SIFT feature invariance
- SIFT feature matching
- object detection using HoG

## Segmentation and Motion
- K-Means and GMM implementations from scratch
- normalized graph-cut and mean shift segmentation
- Lucas-Kanade optic flow detection

## Classifiers
- feature extraction using mean pixel intensities and HoG
- classification of CIFAR-10 dataset using SVMs, Random Forests, and a Voting classifier
- experimentation with hyperparameters to optimize performance

## Final Project: Facial Recognition on surveillance camera
- Acquired a training and testing dataset of images of five test subjects, with a variety of poses, scales, and accessories.
- Built feature vocabularies using SIFT or Harris Corners + HoG or LBP + bag-of-visual-words, or PCA to determine the method with the best performance.
- Created a variety of classifiers to perform facial recognition, tuning hyperparameters to achieve optimal results.
